There are lot of things needed when making a purchase on Amazon.
First thing is a computer.
Second are the hardware such as mouse and keyboard to navigate the Amazon.com to find what you want to purchase.
Third is the software. 
The software I use is windows 11 and web browser I use to search for item is Google Chrome. 
Amazon also makes it easy for shopper so it stores shoppers previous purchase data and previous browser data. 
Amazon can use your previous purchase and browser data to suggest other items you might want to purchase.
